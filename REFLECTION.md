# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?
90 percent.
I have watched 90% of the lecture videos so far.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?
I have scheduled to watch the lecture videos every weekday evening from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM in my study room. This consistent one-hour block helps me stay on track and ensures that I cover all the necessary material.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?
I’m keeping up with my note-taking and revising regularly after each lecture. I also participate actively in class discussions and group work, which helps reinforce my understanding of the material. I plan to continue these habits because they have been effective in my learning process.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?
I need to stop procrastinating on assignments and practical work. Often, I delay starting projects until the last minute, which increases my stress and affects the quality of my work. I plan to adopt a more proactive approach by breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts and setting earlier deadlines for myself.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?
For practicals, I tend to rush through the exercises without spending enough time understanding the underlying concepts. I plan to change this by allocating extra time for reflection and review after each practical session, ensuring I understand the “why” behind each step of the process.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?
I’m doing really well in seeking help when I’m stuck and actively engaging with my peers and instructors during practical sessions. This collaborative approach not only enhances my problem-solving skills but also reinforces my learning. I plan to continue leveraging these interactions to deepen my understanding of Python.
